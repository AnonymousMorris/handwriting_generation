# Handwriting Generation
This is a group project for Computer Vision class Spring 2025.

This repo contains the vector diffusion part that I am working on for the project.

Currently work in progress. Need to figure out why the model isn't training.

## Data
unzip the vmnist.zip in the /data directory

```
cd /data; unzip vmnist.zip
```

## Training

The different models are rewrites which I'm working on.

To train the current model, run

```
python main3.py
```
